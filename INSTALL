INSTALL
---
I had no time to add an installer, or a Makefile.
You need the following modules:

-   Tie::IxHash
-   Perl6::Slurp
-   YAML::Tiny
-   HTTP::Response  (probably already installed)

Plex 2.1 will just need Tie::IxHash ...

Well. Copy the "Plex" directory to the root directory (/) 
[yeah, the / where /etc is] on your linux, unix system.

Now copy the stuff in Config to /etc/plex.

Fix the document root in /etc/plex/plex.cfg, and create at
least one index file there.
